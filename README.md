## Description ##
LettuceCook is a recipe meal application which aims to assist and inspire users to cook! Features such as account-based shopping lists allow users to have a more convenient way of gathering the needed ingredients. Custom created recipes allow users to publish and share with other users of the application!

## Design Process ##
* **Beginners**
    * Beginners may want to use our app to check out a wide variety of recipes to choose from and view the details regarding them to start cooking their dishes.
    * Through the use of the shopping list, beginners can look out for certain ingredients needed to cook their dishes.
    * Beginners can also view YouTube videos that can guide them through the process of creating the dish they have chosen.

* **Regular Cooks**
    * Regular Cooks may want to spice up their dishes by looking up other recipes regarding their normal dishes to improve them.
    * Regular Cooks may use our app to set notification reminders to help them plan out their next meal to cook.
